       <div class="heading"> DATA WE PROCESS </div>
<p>The personal data we process is only basic identification and contact data (email and IP address).
The reason for collecting this data is to secure the subject's access to their gaming account and to
prevent any misuse of their gaming account. We never request personal data that is not necessary
for the purpose (e.g. real name, real surname, place of residence, birth number, ID or other ID
number, copy of a document, etc.).</p>
<div class="heading"> HOW WE USE PERSONAL DATA</div>
<p>We only ever use personal data in the services we provide for the purpose for which the data was
disclosed to us and we always inform the user of this purpose in a transparent manner.
If a game account is inactive for more than 30 days, it will be moved to inactive accounts (i.e.
traceable in the records, points will not be counted in the school cup, basic information will not be
displayed on the profile with his ID. The information entered by the subject at the time of purchase
will still be available, the subject is not obliged to fill in this information and it is up to the subject to
delete it if necessary). If a gaming account has been inactive for more than a year, the subject's
personal information will be deleted. This data is used in case the subject wishes to use the services
again. Assuming the subject does not agree to the one-year deletion period, he/she may contact
EMAIL to request the deletion of the information if the character is moved to inactive. However, this
does not guarantee that the game account, once the information has been deleted and moved to
inactive, can be reinstated.</p>
<div class="heading"> MARKETING MESSAGES</div>
<p>We only use the contact data (e-mail or telephone) of the subjects for contacting them if they have
not logged in for a longer period of time, and this is no more than once every six months and such
communication will not be sent repeatedly.
Anyone has the right to refuse the sending of commercial communications at any time free of
charge by means of a link in the commercial communication or by sending a message to EMAIL . The
conditions of sending commercial communications are regulated in more detail by the provisions of
Section 7 of Act No. 480/2004 Coll., on Certain Information Society Services and on Amendments to
Certain Acts (Act on Certain Information Society Services), as amended.
We would also like to point out that not every message you receive from us is a commercial
message. In the provision of a given service, it is sometimes necessary to communicate with the
subjects, and with a large number of recipients this cannot be done in any other way than by
sending a mass e-mail. Therefore, some of the messages sent are not commercial communications
(for example, notifications of changes to terms and conditions).</p>
<div class="heading"> 
    COOKIES
</div>
<p>
    We use cookies to provide the best possible service to our users. A cookie is a small file that a
website stores on a user's hard drive and is used not to collect personal information about Users (the
information collected may include, for example, the IP address of the connecting computer or the
type of browser used), but to distinguish individual users accessing the URL website. By using the site,
the User agrees to the storage of cookies on his/her computer.
Our website may also contain third-party cookies, which are used to obtain anonymous statistics
about traffic and typical behaviour of Users on individual pages. These third parties generally do
not store any personal data in connection with the use of cookies, as their identity
of the user is unknown (provided that the user is not also a registered user of such third party
products, e.g. Google).
The user can disable the use of cookies in the browser settings, but such an option will affect the
correct display of the site and some features will not be usable.
</p>
<div class="heading"> RIGHTS OF THE DATA SUBJECT</div>
<p>The data subject has the right to request information about the processing of his/her data, the right
to request an explanation, the right to object to the processing or to request limited processing and
the right to contact the supervisory authority, which is the Office for Personal Data Protection, located
at Pplk. Sochor 27, 170 00 Prague 7.
If the subject discovers that his or her personal data are being processed inaccurately or incorrectly,
he or she has the right to have his or her personal data rectified without delay.
Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten")
If personal data is processed on the basis of consent and the data subject withdraws consent, we will
delete the personal data. It should be noted here that we delete those personal data that are stored
at registration or, in the case of an IP address, at login. It does not apply to the data entered by the
subject in the information on their profile. This information can be deleted at any time by the subject
at
URL In case of exercising the right to delete, the entire gaming account of the subject will be
deleted, since the email, as personal data, is necessary for the functioning of the gaming account.
The right of deletion can be exercised by sending a request to EMAIL></p>
<div class="heading"> HOW WE PROTECT YOUR DATA</div>
<p>We declare that we have taken all appropriate technical and organizational measures to secure
personal data. Only the management of the project has access to the data in order to check for
violations of the rules, to contact the subject or to correct the data if necessary. In addition, the
data, such as passwords, are encrypted, so that no one who has access to the personal data has the
means to find out the password. This technical solution also implies that anyone who is not the
subject cannot change the password except by restarting it. Only the subject can change the
password without restarting it using the form at the URL.
In the event that an entity provides a password to another entity, the entity that provided access to
its gaming account is responsible for its actions and there is no possibility of replacing lost or altered
data made by another entity using the provided login credentials.</p>
<div class="heading"> AUTHOR'S WORKS</div>
<p>Copyright works may be created in the course of the subject's use of the service. A work of
authorship is considered to be a work created by the subject that is original. Works of authorship
are not considered to be works of authorship taken from
from other sources (e.g. wikipedia, google images, etc.). An image or photo, demonstrably created
by the subject, is considered to be a work of authorship. For example, for an avatar on a game
account. Also, homework assignments that were created by the subject, homework assignments that
were created by the subject, final papers that were created by the subject or various descriptive
texts that were created by the subject or project management and not taken from other sources.
Management reserves the right to use and process copyright works within the domain
URL without the subject's consent, but always only
indicating the subject, author of the work. If the subject does not agree with the use, the work will be
removed after a request to EMAIL, unless this seriously disrupts the functioning of the service.
The management also reserves the right to store archives from in-game chats and further process
them for the purpose of scoring, checking whether there has been a violation of the rules, possibly
providing archives to subjects in the position of professors or players for further processing.</p>
