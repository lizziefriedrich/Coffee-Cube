<h2>Order</h2>
<p>Goods displayed on the www.promocevse.cz website may only be ordered and purchased
by a natural person who has full legal capacity, or by a person acting on behalf of a legal
person who meets the same conditions.
Ordering Goods is done by selecting the Goods and placing them in the Basket. The
Customer's order becomes binding for the Customer by sending it to the Operator via the
E-shop. After completing and submitting the Order in the specified manner, the Customer
will receive a written confirmation of the Order from the Seller via e-mail.
The order confirmation contains: order number, contact details, billing or delivery address,

On the day when it will be possible to collect the purchased (ordered) Goods (other than
those ordered only in digital form) at the place designated for personal collection, or when
they will be handed over to the carrier, the Customer will be informed of this fact by e-mail or
by telephone.
The Operator reserves the right to cancel the Order without giving reasons. Cancellation of
the Order may be made by the Operator no later than before the Goods are dispatched to
the Customer.
The Operator reserves the right to change the form of transport chosen by the Customer. In
the case of payment on delivery, the amount due will be reduced by the relevant difference
and the Customer will be informed of this fact. In the case of an order that has already been
paid for, the Customer will also be informed and the difference in the order will then be
immediately refunded to the Customer.
Other changes in delivery, either by the Operator or by the Customer, can be made only after
agreement between the Operator and the Customer, or approval of the change by the
Customer. Title to the Goods shall pass to the Customer upon payment of the full purchase
price and acceptance of the Goods.</p>

                <li>Parcel carrier PPL, PPL service (only in the Czech Republic):

                </li>
            </ul>

<p>The customer is obliged to take over the item within one month of the expiry of the time when
the order was ready for acceptance. If he fails to do so, he is obliged to pay the storage fee for
the order. For an order not collected within one month from the expiry of the time when the
order should have been made, we charge a storage fee of CZK 5 per calendar day. After six
months from the date on which the order was made, the Seller may shred the order, without
prejudice to the Seller's right to payment of the order price including the storage fee.</p>
<h2>Warranty period</h2>
<p>The Seller provides a legal warranty for all Goods offered in the E-shop. The warranty does not
cover normal wear and tear of the Goods. A shorter lifetime of the Goods, which results from the
nature of the Goods, does not give rise to liability of the Seller and a defect arising in direct
connection with such shorter lifetime cannot be claimed.
The warranty period begins at the moment of receipt of the Goods by the Customer.
The warranty period applies only to Customers who act in this relationship as a consumer
under the Civil Code.
The method of exercising rights due to product defects is regulated by the Complaints Code.
Withdrawal
The Customer has the right to withdraw from the purchase contract arising from the purchase
of Goods in the E-shop if the Seller significantly breaches any of its obligations.
Until the contract is completed, the Customer may withdraw from the contract, but is obliged
to pay the Operator the amount due for the work already carried out, unless the contractor
can use the result of the work in another way and to reimburse him for the costs reasonably
incurred. Therefore, if the withdrawal from the contract occurs before the Contractor has
started processing the order, such withdrawal shall be free of charge. However, if the
processing of the order has already begun, the Customer shall pay the amount corresponding
to the work already performed.
The Customer may withdraw from the contract if it is obvious that the order will not be
completed within the agreed time or will not be performed properly, and if the Seller fails to
remedy the situation even within a reasonable period of time.
Withdrawal of the Customer from the contract within 14 days of receipt of the performance
(completed order) is not possible in case of conclusion of the contract by means of remote
communication (e.g. internet),
because of the statutory exception under Section 53(8)(c) of the Civil Code, which excludes
such withdrawal from the contract for the supply of Goods adapted to the consumer's wishes
or for the consumer's person.
The Seller has the right to withdraw from the Contract at the latest before the Goods are
dispatched. The reason for withdrawal by the Seller may only be the unavailability of the
Goods in question, caused by a technical defect, or other factual circumstances that make
it unreasonably difficult for the Seller to fulfil its obligations under the contract, and these
circumstances have arisen independently of
at the will of the Seller. Withdrawal from the contract must in all cases be in writing.
Electronic means of communication shall also be deemed to be in writing.
Personal data protection
The Seller collects, with the consent of the customers, the personal data of the customers,
namely: name, surname, e-mail, residence, telephone, or other delivery and billing address.
For this case, the Operator is registered with the Office for Personal Data Protection. The
collected personal data is mainly used to facilitate the Customer's orders in the future.
If the Customer expresses his/her Consent, the Operator may communicate commercial
communications to him/her by e-mail and telephone.
Consent means checking the box of consent to the processing of personal data, which must be
checked before sending the order for processing.
The Operator may only provide the Customer's data to a contracted photo lab processing printed
photographs for the purpose of distribution. The contract photo lab is contractually obliged to
remove the data from its database immediately after the order is processed. The provision of
personal data via the registration form is voluntary, but without proper completion, the Goods
cannot be delivered.
The data that the Operator stores and processes about the Customer can be changed by the
Customer at any time after logging into his User Account.
The customer may withdraw his/her consent to the storage and processing of personal data or
to the sending of commercial communications at any time by sending an e-mail to
info@promocevse.cz in which he/she expresses his/her disagreement.
Binding
By concluding the contract, the Customer confirms that he/she has read these terms and
conditions and that
agrees with them. The buyer is notified of these terms and conditions sufficiently before the
order is placed and has the opportunity to familiarize himself with them. These terms and
conditions form an integral part of the concluded contract. The contract is concluded in the
Czech language, unless circumstances on the part of the seller or the buyer prevent it, the
contract may also be concluded in another language understandable to the parties.
The Seller reserves the right to change these terms and conditions, and any changes will be
published on the website www.promocevse.cz . The binding effect of such changed terms and
conditions begins with their publication.
All legal relations arising from the purchase and sale of Goods are governed by Czech law,
unless otherwise provided by mandatory rules of international law.
Other arrangements
All terms that begin with capital letters shall mean the terms defined in the preamble to
these Terms and Conditions.
All prices quoted in the E-shop are inclusive of VAT.
Complaints Procedure
We provide a statutory six-month warranty period for the completed order. In the event that
the Customer discovers a defect in the purchased Goods during the warranty period, which was
not caused by improper use, but by a defect in the product itself, the Customer has the right to
claim the goods during the warranty period in accordance with this Complaints Procedure.
The warranty period starts from the date of acceptance of the order
Upon receipt of a parcel delivered by postal services, it is the customer's responsibility to check
the external condition of the parcel. In case of external damage to the parcel, do not accept the
parcel from the carrier and contact us.
The Seller is responsible for the completeness of the undamaged shipment. Complaints are
made by the Customer in person at the Operator's registered office or through postal services.
In the case of using postal services, the Customer shall send the defective goods suitably
packaged to the Seller's registered office, together with an accompanying cover letter, where
he/she shall describe the alleged defects and the circumstances preceding the manifestation of
these defects. At the same time, the Customer shall attach to the letter documents proving the
Seller's liability for the claimed goods (invoice, e-mail of the order, copy of the order in the e-
mail) or attach an affidavit of purchase of the goods with the data matching
with the order (Customer's name, full address and approximate date of order).
The Seller shall not be liable for any damage caused to the claimed goods during
transportation to the Seller by postal services, whether such damage is
caused by improper transport or improper packaging. When making a claim by post, we
recommend sending the goods as a valuable package, not by cash on delivery (goods sent on
delivery will not be accepted).
The Seller is obliged to issue a written confirmation to the Customer when the Customer's right
to
from liability for defects, what is the content of the claim and what method of handling
the claim the Customer requires, as well as confirmation of the date and method of
handling the claim, including confirmation of the repair of the order and the duration of
its duration, or written justification for the rejection of the claim.
The Seller shall bear the cost of transport in the event of an accepted claim.
Claims within the warranty period do not apply to defects in the workmanship caused by:
• mechanical damage and wear and tear
• natural disasters (water, fire, lightning)
• light and temperature influences</p>
